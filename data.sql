1. Normalization
Break down data into smaller, related tables to eliminate redundancy.

Organize data in structured formats (e.g., First Normal Form, Second Normal Form).

Example: Split a single table containing customer details and order information into separate Customers and Orders tables.

2. Using Data Types
Ensure appropriate data types for columns like INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE, etc., based on the category of data.

Example: Use DATE for expense dates and DECIMAL for amounts in an Expense Tracker database.

3. Primary and Foreign Keys
Use unique identifiers (Primary Keys) for table rows, and connect related tables with Foreign Keys.

Example: ExpenseID in Expenses table acts as a Primary Key while being linked to CategoryID in a Categories table.

4. Categorization Columns
Create columns explicitly for categorizing data.

Example: Add a Category column in an Expenses table to classify entries like "Travel," "Food," or "Office Supplies."

5. Hierarchical Categories
Use parent-child relationships for multi-level categorization.

Example: Group categories under broader themesâ€”Office Supplies under Work Expenses.

6. Indexes
Create indexes to improve query performance for specific categories.

Example: Index the Category column for faster retrieval of categorized data.

7. Tags and Keywords
Use tag-based categorization for flexible classification.

Example: Add tags like "High Priority" or "Recurring" to rows for better filtering.

8. Views
Create virtual tables (views) to display categorized data dynamically.

Example: A view showing only Travel Expenses from the main Expenses table.

9. Partitioning
Split large tables into smaller partitions based on specific criteria.

Example: Partition an Expenses table by year, e.g., Expenses_2025 and Expenses_2024.

10. Constraints
Apply constraints to enforce categories.

Example: Define allowable values for a column using CHECK constraints (e.g., Category column must be "Travel," "Food," or "Office Supplies").
